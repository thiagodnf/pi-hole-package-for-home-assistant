## ðŸ”§ Setup Instructions

**Step 1.** To access the Pi-hole API, authentication is required. This process returns session details, including the `sid` and `csrf` tokens.

```bash
curl -k -X POST "https://pi.hole/api/auth" --data '{"password":"your-password"}'
```

Just replace `your-password` by your actual password. If everything went well, you would see the following json as output:

```json
{
  "session": {
    "valid": true,
    "totp": false,
    "sid": "vFA+EP4MQ5JJvJg+3Q2Jnw=",
    "csrf": "Ux87YTIiMOf/GKCefVIOMw=",
    "validity": 300
  },
  "took": 0.0002
}
```
You will need the `sid` and `csrf`. For more information, please read [the authentication page](https://docs.pi-hole.net/api/auth/).


**Step 1.** Add your Pi-hole credentials to `secrets.yaml`:

```yaml
pihole_sid: "yourSid="
pihole_csrf: "yourCsrf="
```

**Step 2.** Create a folder named "packages" and place `pihole.yaml` inside it, following the structure below.

```
custom_components/
packages/
    pihole.yaml         # Add the package file here
secrets.yaml            # Required secrets
configuration.yaml      # Must include the package
```

**Step 3.** Update the `configuration.yaml` file adding the following:

```yaml
homeassistant:
  packages: !include_dir_named packages
```

**Step 4.** Open `pihole.yaml`, locate all instances of `<PIHOLE_SERVER_URL>`, and replace them with the actual IP address or hostname of your Pi-hole server. For example:

From:

```yaml
url: "<PIHOLE_SERVER_URL>/api/action/gravity"
```

To:

```yaml
url: "192.168.1.72/api/action/gravity"
```
